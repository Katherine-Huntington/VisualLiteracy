<h1>Unity</h1>

<h2>Individual Designs</h2>
<p>A good design will have a good sense of unity or harmony; that is, every element in the design will fit together somehow, like they belong together. The easiest way to achieve unity is by consistency. Simply using the same few line types, shapes, colors, and even textures all throughout the design can go a long way.</p>

<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>Unity is especially important in branding; the consistent usage of such elements in all of your posters, websites and even product packaging will cause your audience to begin to associate those particular element combinations with you. A consistent brand will create an air of reliability and trustworthiness to your business, subconsciously telling the audience that they can trust you to provide high quality goods or services any time. This is probably why you'd rather eat at a McDonalds instead of a local restaurant you've never seen before; you have a very strong association between the McDonald's logo, color scheme, etc. and delicious food, but this isn't the same case with the local restaurant. This is especially the case if the local restaurant's brand is inconsistent across its various designs or is simply ugly to look at.</p>
<p>A consistent brand is important if you want to be seen as a reliable company. It's also important for making a business memorable. Some brands like Amazon or Chick-fil-a are universally recognizable even if the particular design doesn't include the name of the business.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>This is even useful for implicitly badmouthing other businesses. For example, before you read any more, take a second to watch this <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/2rAM/us-cellular-mean-what-you-say-unlimited-data" target="_blank">commercial by US Cellular</a>, which prides itself on providing unlimited data with no caveats.</p>
                <p>The sign at the beginning of the commercial belongs to an unnamed cell service company that also provides unlimited data... granted that you buy four lines, first. Even though uscellular never names the other company in the commercial, closer inspection makes it clear that the creators of the commercial are referring to Verizon. The sign uses Verizon’s iconic color scheme of red, white and black, causing the audience to subconsciously perceive Verizon as untrustworthy, unreliable, and overall undesirable.</p>

<h2>Achieving Unity</h2>
<p>One way to achieve unity is by placing objects in close proximity to each other. Sometimes, the objects may even be connected to each other. In any case, this kind of proximity can make the objects appear figuratively inseparable as well as literally.</p>
<p>Repetition is also vital to achieving unity. Even a photograph of a messy work desk can appear united if the objects cluttering the desk have a common theme or if there are multiple of each object, such as pens or stacks of papers.</p>
<p>In designs where it is impossible to repeat elements or tie all of the elements to a common theme, selecting a color scheme and using it all throughout is very important in creating unity. Even objects that seemingly have nothing to do with each other will seem to belong together as long as you have the right colors.</p>
<p>Lines are useful for connecting elements that may not otherwise be easy to associate with each other. They’re a great way to create a path for your viewer’s eyes to follow, whether they’re straight or curvy, thin or thick, dotted or solid, or even if they have an arrow head.</p>
