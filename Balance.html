<h1>Balance</h1>
<p>Balance refers to the distribution of visual weight in an artwork; that is, the weight an object seems to have. Truly, everything weighs the same in 2D art (because it's all on a computer screen or sheet of paper), but some objects will still just “seem” heavier than others.</p>
<p>Depending on the purposes of your design, you may want even or uneven balance. Generally, even balance will suggest stability, strength or order, while uneven balance may suggest instability or chaos. Balance is typically utilized to create <a href="Emphasis.html">focal points</a>, which I definitely touch on in this article.</p>
<p>The sense of balance (or lack thereof) depends on planes of symmetry. Symmetry is generally achieved by similarities in the sizes, shapes and positions of objects on opposite sides of an imaginary dividing line. Of course, not all designs will be exactly symmetrical. However, you can still create a sense of approximate symmetry (or symmetrical balance), which may show slight variations in size, shape or position but still creates a symmetrical vibe. Asymmetrical balance is created when one or more of these variations are not slight but stark.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of planes of symmetry that you can utilize to create a sense of symmetry. These are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Horizontal Balance:</span> When weight is organized around opposite sides of a vertical plane.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Vertical Balance:</span> When weight is organized around opposite sides of a horizontal plane.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Diagonal Balance:</span> When weight is organized around opposite sides of a diagonal plane.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Radial Balance:</span> When weight is organized around a central point in a design.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at an example of each kind of balance.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Fig. 1</span> is an example of <span class="highlight">horizontal balance</span>, where visual weight is distributed the same way on the left and right side of the design. Notice the lack of vertical balance, however, as your eyes gravitate upwards towards the box that says “Visual Literacy.” The box seems heavier than all the other elements of the design. This is due to two reasons. The first reason is that the inverted colors create contrast: on the left side of the design, the big chunk of brown contrasts with the plain pink background, and on the right, the pink contrasts with the brown background. The second reason is related to the size of the box; it takes up much more space than any other text segment on the design. Even the font inside the box is bigger than the fonts outside of the box.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Fig. 2</span> is an example of <span class="highlight">vertical balance</span>; the weight distribution on the top is similar to that on the bottom. Although the words “Visual Literacy” are much larger and thus very heavy, the words “learn how to create quality designs for free at www.visualiteracy.com” are much more numerous and occupy a similar amount of space, so both halves of the designs have a similar visual weight. However, “Visual Literacy” is still the first part to catch our attention due to the size and boldness of the font.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Fig. 3</span> is an example of <span class="highlight">diagonal balance</span>, because an imaginary diagonal line cuts between the two purple triangles. The text bordering the design also shows diagonal symmetry, and even the text in the middle can be considered diagonally symmetrical, as well. Out of the four examples, this one shows the most even distribution of weight across the entire design: the focal point is the block of pink text in the middle of the design, but it's not much heavier than the bordering text, causing your eyes to bounce around more.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Fig. 4</span> is an example of <span class="highlight">radial balance</span>, where weight is distributed in a way that resembles a circle. Most of the weight is packed into the giant orange star in the center of the design. This causes our eyes to focus on the words “Quality Designs,” which are also quite large and come in a vibrant, complimentary blue, allowing it to stick out from the orange and yellow. The surrounding stars and the background appear to decrease in luminosity as they get further away from the star, with the blue stars appearing dimmer than the orange star, and the purple stars appearing even dimmer than the blue stars. The dimmer an object, the less weight it seems to have and the less our eyes gravitate towards it. The purple stars are also spaced apart more than the blue stars are, so the edges of the design appear emptier and thus less weighty than the center.</li>
</ul>
