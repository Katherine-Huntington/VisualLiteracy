<h1>Proportion</h1>
<p>Proportion refers to the size of one thing in relation to another thing. Using the correct proportions is very important for creating a visual hierarchy, which guides our eyes around the design in order of most important to least important element. For example, take a look at this graphic by the Graphic Design forum <span class="highlight">(Fig. 1)</span>. Humans generally read from top to bottom. Yet, even though “And you will read this last” is on the very top, we start by reading “You will read this first” because the font is very large and it's also in a giant white box.</p>
<p>Any time you make a design, particularly a commercial design like an advertisement, you should make it in such a way as to instantly grab the viewer's attention; incentivize him to stop what he's doing and read the design in its entirety. To do that, you need some kind of hook: a short and concise word, phrase or sentence that piques his interest; that appeals to his wants or needs; that answers the question, “what's in it for me?” This hook should be the largest element on your poster. It should be the first thing he notices. In the case of a poster or sign, it should be large enough to read from a distance.</p>

<h3>Bake Sale Poster</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a fictitious bake sale advertisement <span class="highlight">(Fig. 2)</span> I created. What did you see first? Most likely the giant “Bake Sale” text. Then you probably glanced over the “$2” and down towards the “cookies, cupcakes, chocolate & more!” After that, you read the full “starting at $2 per item” if you hadn't already, along with everything else.</p>
<p>Notice how the most informational pieces of text are also the smallest and thinnest. This is because people have short attention spans, and if you start off by telling your viewer the who, the when, the where and the why, he's going to lose interest before you can get to the what; the good stuff; the thing he cares about.</p>
<p>On the one hand, most people just don't care very much about the NHS and might not see how they could benefit from supporting it. On the other hand, everyone loves baked goods, and everyone loves to buy stuff for low prices. Logically, then, my hook should appeal to the viewer's taste buds. That’s pretty easy; just type “Bake Sale” in big bold letters, accompanied by some high-definition images of tasty snacks, and now anyone with a sweet tooth (which is almost everyone) will instantly want more information and actually take the time to read all the whos, wheres and whys (which I have also provided in smaller text).</p>
