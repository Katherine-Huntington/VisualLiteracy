<h1>Emphasis</h1>
<p>Take a second to look at your surroundings. Does anything stick out to you? Perhaps there's a boldly colored poster on the wall, or a vase of bright yellow flowers on the table, or a sparkling diamond necklace that another girl is wearing.</p>
<p>These things are all examples of focal points: parts of an artwork or environment that catch our eye. An effective focal point will seem to dominate the work, even if it doesn't actually take up a whole lot of space, and emphasize its immediate surroundings as well. There are a few ways to create an effective focal point.</p>

<h2>Directional Lines</h2>
<p><a href="Line.html">Lines</a>, actual or implied, can be used to direct the eyes to a particular spot on an artwork. Our brains love to look at things, so our eyes tend to gravitate towards lines and shapes, especially if the background is plain and undetailed.</p>
<p>Since eyes are attracted to lines, you can draw lines to point to what you want the audience to look at. Generally, our eyes go left to right along horizontal lines and top to bottom along vertical lines. In the case of several lines that intersect, our eyes are drawn even more strongly to those points of intersection. The line doesn't even have to be a line; it can be an array of objects that form a line.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="Shape.html">shapes</a>, our eyes will prefer to look at the borders of those shapes rather than the insides of the shape, especially if the inside doesn't have very much texture. After all, the border determines the type of shape you're looking at.</p>

<h2>Contrast</h2>
<p>Differences in the utilization of an element of art will tend to draw our eyes.</p>
<p>When using <a href="Value.html">values</a> to create a focal point, you may either create a high-key focal point that sticks out from a low-key environment, or a low-key focal point in a high-key environment. Even something as simple as a small black dot will draw our eyes if placed on an otherwise blank sheet of printing paper. In the same way, the shine of a lantern will draw our eyes if placed in a pitch black room.</p>
<p>Generally, brighter, warmer <a href="Color.html">colors</a> like reds and yellows are much more attention-grabbing than cooler colors like greens and blues, and are go-to colors for creating highlights. However, the key to contrast is not the colors in and of themselves, but the colors' relationships to each other: how the colors of the focal point jump out from the surrounding colors. A touch of blue in a predominantly yellow artwork can be just as attention-grabbing as a touch of yellow in a blue artwork.</p>
<p><a href="Time.html">Dynamics</a> can also be used to create contrast. If someone were to open the door of whatever room you're in, you'd be much more likely to notice the movement of that door if the room was empty and motionless than if the room was bustling with energetic people. In the same way, your eyes may be drawn to a dynamic focal point in a stationary environment, or a stationary focal point in a dynamic environment. A stationary focal point may be a little more difficult to emphasize, since our eyes are naturally drawn to movement, but it's possible. You may use other elements such as color or line to further emphasize the stationary object, or you may just place it in a really good spot.</p>

<h2>Other Ways to Create Focal Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Size:</span> Things that take up more space in our visual field are more likely to grab our attention first, while things that appear smaller are noticed later. To see what I mean, simply look at this design from the Graphic Design forum (Fig. 3).</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Balance:</span> You may create a focal point by distributing the lion's share of the <a href="Balance.html">visual weight</a> into a particular area, making the area seem heavier than the rest of the design. Balance may sometimes go hand in hand with size.</li>
