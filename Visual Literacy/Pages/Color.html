<h1>Color</h1>
<p>Color can have many uses. They can create moods; convey lights, shadows, and depth; and emphasize particular focal points of a design. Designers often utilize color wheels and color schemes to create effective color combinations.</p>

<h2 id="Properties-Of-Color">Properties of Color</h2>
<p>There are three common properties that make each color unique: hue, <a href="Value.html">value</a>, and intensity.</p>

<h3>Hue</h3>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>A color's hue is its categorization. It's the color's basic name; the umbrella term for a family of colors; the word you use to quickly describe something. “The car was red,” you might say. “Her nails are purple.” “That mold is green.” The English language identifies eleven different hues under which every color falls: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, pink, brown, white, black, and gray. However, this is not an exhaustive list. Technically, a pine needle is a different color from an oak leaf, but they both share the same hue: green.</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Value</h3>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>Value is the lightness or darkness of a hue, which is determined by how much black or white is in the hue. Adding black to a hue makes it a shade; white makes it a tint, and gray makes it a tone. For instance, maroon is a shade of red, and pink is a tint of red.</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>If you don't want to use different tints, shades, or tones of a color, but you still want to create the illusion of luminosity, you can achieve a similar effect by using different hues. Even if all of the colors you use in a design are the same value, some colors will naturally appear brighter than others. Yellow is the brightest-looking hue, and violet is the darkest-looking. Generally speaking, warm colors will appear brighter than cool colors. It's also important to note that the perceived value of a color depends on the colors that surround it; a color will appear more luminous when surrounded by darker colors and less luminous when surrounded by lighter colors.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Intensity</h3>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>The intensity (also known as saturation or purity) of a color is its brightness or dullness. Pure colors are very bright, like the colors of a rainbow, or of sun rays beaming through the window in the morning. However, even a pure color may appear dark, depending on whether its surroundings are lighter or darker in comparison. Mixing a color with black, white, or its complement will change its saturation as well as its value, but even colors with a similar hue and value can have different intensities.</p>

<!--COLORS AND MOODS-->
<h2 id="Colors-And-Moods">Colors and Moods</h2>
<p>Colors can convey all sorts of meanings, from energetic reds and yellows to calm blues and purples, to clean whites and mysterious blacks. Here is a non-exhaustive guide of various adjectives to describe major color categories. Note that these adjectives are generally drawn from the real world. For instance, red conveys danger because it's the color of fire or blood; blue is cooler and more refreshing because it's the color of the ocean or the sky; and white is clean and pure because it's the color of snow, clouds, or well-kept teeth.</p>

<h3>Red</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bright reds are very energetic, stimulating and dynamic colors that can instill a wide range of emotions, from courage, adventure, and excitement to assertiveness, spontaneity and drama. If used incorrectly (or correctly, depending on your intentions), they can also convey negative ideas such as violence, aggression, and danger.</li>
    <li>Darker or deeper reds are more refined, elegant and expensive. These are great for advertising luxury items, for example.</li>
    <li>Brick reds tend to have an air of earthiness, warmth, sturdiness, or even rustic settings.</li>
    <li>Bright pink is essentially a more youthful, playful, or even tropical variant of bright red. Both are very attention-grabbing. It's a good color for making a design or feature stick out, but too much bright pink can make the design look obnoxious.</li>
    <li>Light pinks are youthful just like bright pinks are, but they're significantly softer, gentler, and even sweeter than bright pinks. They can also convey a sense of compassion, innocence, or delicateness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Orange</h3>
<p>Orange, being a combination of red and yellow, also has many traits in common with the two colors, generally being warm, energizing and spontaneous as well as gregarious and happy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vibrant oranges are hot, spontaneous and energetic as well as happy, friendly, and optimistic. Some vibrant oranges can even remind people of fruits like oranges or tangerines, giving a juicy, tangy or citrusy look to your design. Too much of it can make your design too loud.</li>
    <li>Like brick reds, brick oranges are earthy and warm, but also have a more welcoming atmosphere.</li>
    <li>Red-oranges remind people of spices and can make something look exotic.</li>
    <li>Light oranges and peaches are soft and sweet like light pinks, but also warm and inviting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yellow</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bright yellows are often used to convey a sense of innovation or enlightenment or even light itself. This makes sense, considering that it's the color of the sun. It can also be joyful, lively and friendly, or it can instill a sense of caution or surprise. If used in certain ways, yellow can also give off cowardly or hazardous vibes.</li>
    <li>Golden yellows are like bright yellows, but more hospitable and comforting. Think butter and wheat and mac & cheese; these are all comfort foods.</li>
    <li>Darker yellows, like amber colors, can remind people of foreign jewelry or autumn leaves. It's a more mellow kind of yellow.</li>
    <li>Golds give a sense of prestige, value, richness, or even divinity.</li>
    <li>Light yellows are soft, sunny, and sweet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Green</h3>
<p>Most kinds of greens remind people of nature, fertility, or health. It combines the friendliness and vitality of yellow with the tranquility, coolness, and faithfulness of blue.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Brighter greens tend to be fresh and lively and may remind people of spring. </li>
    <li>Darker greens remind people of woods and forests, and also have a cool, quiet and refreshing vibe. They can also remind people of money and prosperity, or instill feelings of trustworthiness and reliability.</li>
    <li>Other foliage greens may be reassuring, reminding people of rest or new beginnings. Lime greens in particular have a youthful, fresh, citrusy feel, while olive greens can remind people of the military and camouflage. Too much olive green can make a design dull, however.</li>
    <li>Blue-greens tend to remind people of water, coolness, the sky, and even abstract concepts like faithfulness. Lighter blue-greens have a soft, youthful, or dreamy and lightweight feel, while darker blue-greens suggest tastefulness, sophistication, or confidence. Turquoise has a tropical feel to it, though it's also a popular color in jewelry advertisements.</li>
    <li>Light greens are soothing and quiet. It's considered a neutral color, and is lightweight like light blue-greens are.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bright blues are surprisingly energetic, vibrant, or even electric; they can also have an aquatic feel.</li>
    <li>Light blues are calm, cool, quiet, and even patient or clean. Sky blues in particular are expansive, reassuring, faithful, dependable, or trusting.</li>
    <li>Dark or deep blues are stronger, more confident, or more authoritative. They may also be nautical, loyal, introspective, or traditional, and they remind people of the navy. Dark blues may also have more negative themes such as aloofness or sadness, so be careful with dark blues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Purple</h3>
<p>Purple combines the coolness and thoughtfulness of blue with the explosiveness and assertiveness of red, resulting in quite a mysterious and magical color. A perfect half-and-half of blue and red is complicated to some people, so designers will often skew the purple to be more red or more blue.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blue purples are more mysterious and enchanting, as well as more thoughtful or even spiritual.</li>
    <li>Red purples are more thrilling, exciting, or dramatic.</li>
    <li>Dark purples convey richness, royalty, prestige, vision, and introspection. It can also be used to convey distance or aloofness.</li>
    <li>Lavenders and light purples are nostalgic and lightweight.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brown</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tans are seen as rugged, outdoorsy, and rustic.</li>
    <li>Chocolate browns are rich, appetizing, or robust.</li>
    <li>Earth browns are wholesome, warm, sturdy, and traditional.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Neutrals</h3>
<p>Neutrals mostly tend to feel... well, neutral, as well as classic, practical and inconspicuous.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Neutral grays can be corporate, efficient and practical, or they can be quiet, timeless or modest. They give an air of neutrality and timelessness.</li>
    <li>Charcoal grays are similar to neutral grays, except much more sophisticated, solid, and even responsible and conscientious. Like navy blue, it can be seen as conservative and steadfast. If used in certain ways, it can also be described as dull, conformist, or detached.</li>
    <li>Taupes are a more authentic, organic alternative to gray. It can also give a sense of blandness, depending on your intentions.</li>
    <li>Off-whites aren't quite as corporate or practical as other neutrals. They're softer, warmer, and smoother. Depending on how you use it, it could even denote comfort or sweet tastes. Like taupes, they're also quite natural. However, it can also make something look boring, if you're not careful.</li>
    <li>Silver is like gray, but cooler. It's sleek and stylish; like gold, but modernized. It's coolness makes it look good with other cool colors like blue or green.</li>
</ul>

<h3>White</h3>
<ul>
    <li>White is a very pure, clean, pristine color. Think of a fresh blanket of snow. It may also give an ethereal, airy, or lightweight vibe, as in fluffy clouds in the sky or snowflakes dancing gently in the air. Clean as it is, it can represent innocence, simplicity, or even silence.</li>
    <li>Depending on the context, however, white can also be sterile, cold, clinical, or even deathly. Think of a doctor's office, a padded cell, a biting blizzard. Think of ghosts, vampires, and bones. Think of how fear or shock flushes the blood from your face.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Black</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Black tends to be a very powerful, heavy, bold color. It may also look elegant, sophisticated, expensive, or even prestigious. Like silver, it's very stylish (which is why they look so good together). Depending on the context, it can also be mysterious and even magical. It's the color of nighttime.</li>
    <li>It can also be a very menacing color, representing negative themes such as death, depression, mourning, and evil. It's the color of infection, rot, and decay.</li>
    <li></li>

<!--COLOR SCHEMES-->
<h2 id="Color-Schemes">Color Schemes</h2>
<p>When making a color scheme, you want to keep in mind the <a href="#Colors-And-Moods">meanings</a> of each color. For example, if you want to make your design more energetic, you might use bright blue and bright pink as accent colors; purple and black together convey a strong sense of mystery; orange and dark brown stimulate the appetite. Whatever colors you choose, they should convey something about your product or message.</p>
<p>Your design does not have to strictly follow a particular color scheme. It's more like a suggestion; a place to get started for creating the perfect color combination. Also remember that not all of your colors need to be equally bright or saturated; variations in saturation can add even more depth to your design. Feel free to experiment!</p>

        <tr style="width:auto">
            <td>
                <p><span class="highlight">Monochromatic:</span> Varying shades and tints of one color. This color scheme is useful if you want to hyperfocus on one theme or message that may be associated with one color, such as an all green scheme for a design that promotes nature, or an all black scheme to convey the negativity of a horrific event.</p>

Think of how a red rose sticks out from its green foliage background. If you want one part of your design to stand out, such as a particular block of text, then this is a good color scheme to use. If you’re feeling philosophical, you can even use this to emphasize one idea or emotion above another (remember that colors are connected to emotions). If the two colors are both very bright, this may create a flickering effect; if you don’t want this, try turning down one of the colors’ saturation, or else separate the two colors with something more neutral.</p>
